# 1)
# Create a function named
# "triple" that takes one
# parameter, x, and returns
# the value of x multiplied
# by three.
#

def triple(x):
    triple_x = x*3
    return triple_x

# 2)
# Create a function named "subtract" that
# takes two parameters and returns the result of
# the second value subtracted from the first.
#

def subtract(x,y):
    subtract_two = x-y
    return subtract_two

# 3)
# Create a function called "dictionary_maker"
# that has one parameter: a list of 2-tuples.
# It should return the same data in the form
# of a dictionary, where the first element
# of every tuple is the key and the second
# element is the value.

tuple = []

def dictionary_maker(tuple):
    return tuple


#
# For example, if given: [('foo', 1), ('bar', 3), ('hi', 5)]
# it should return {'foo': 1, 'bar': 3, 'hi': 5}
# You should program the function and not use
# the function "dict" directly
